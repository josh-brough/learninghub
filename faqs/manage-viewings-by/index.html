<h1>Are available booking slots taken from the agent's availability or the vendors?</h1>
<p>
You have the ability to choose whether appointments are booked against your own availability (in cases where no vendor is present), against the buyers availability (for when the vendor is doing their own viewings), or against both availabilities at the same time (for accompanied viewings). When making a booking against both the agent’s and the vendor’s availabilities, the Hystreet system will only show on the consumer site appointment booking slots that are open for both.</P>
<p>
To change which availability you want to use, simply go to properties -> view (on the property in question) -> details -> manage and select the desired setting in the ‘viewings by’ drop down menu.</p>
